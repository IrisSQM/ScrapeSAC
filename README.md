Scrape licensee info from SAC

There are two outputs:
- firmind.csv: info about each licensee in each firm
- ind_ch.csv: records of status changes for each licensee (can be used to analyze mobility of licensees)

The codes are preliminary, need to be polished further.

The biggest problems:
- it's slow
- it happens to miss some entries
